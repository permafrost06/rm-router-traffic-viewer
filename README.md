# rm-router-traffic-viewer
Rainmeter skin for displaying traffic statistics from TP-Link WR720N Router [_using my tptools router api_](https://github.com/permafrost06/tptools).

## Only tested with TP-Link WR720N, requires a Python3 script to be running in the background (included in this repository).
